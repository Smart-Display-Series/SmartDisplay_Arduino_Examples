## Introduction

lcdgfx driver is C++ library with unicode support. The library can be compiled for plain Linux
(for example, raspberry spi), or you can use it with plain avr-gcc compiler without Arduino IDE. It supports
monochrome and RGB oleds and has debug mode, allowing to execute code on Linux, Windows and macOS, using SDL2.0.
The library is intended to run on small microcontrollers. It is developed to use as few resources as possible,
but still has powerful capabilities (NanoEngine), allowing to develop nice animation.
It works also on any powerful devices like raspberry pi, esp32; and can be easily ported to new platform.
This library integrates another library [canvas](https://github.com/lexus2k/canvas)

## Documentation

For more information about this library, please, visit https://github.com/lexus2k/lcdgfx.
Documentation generated by doxygen tool can be found at [codedocs xyz site](https://codedocs.xyz/lexus2k/lcdgfx).
The library provides numerous usage [examples](https://github.com/lexus2k/lcdgfx/tree/master/examples).

## Easy to use

Example:

```.cpp
DisplayST7735_128x160x16_SPI display(3,{-1, 4, 5, 0,-1,-1});

void setup()
{
    display.begin();
    display.clear();
}

void loop()
{
    display.setColor(RGB_COLOR16(255,255,0));
    display.drawLine(10,30,56,96);
}
```

## Key Features

 * Supports color, monochrome OLED displays
 * The library has modular structure, and some modules can be excluded from compilation at all to reduce flash usage.
 * **Very small footprint** ( Draw text example uses only 5KiB of Flash with I2C code, display code, font!!! and application itself.
   Examples without fonts start at 2.5KiB of Flash )
 * **Very small RAM consumption** ( Attiny85 with Damellis package needs minimum 30 bytes of RAM to communicate with OLED )
 * Fast implementation to provide reasonable speed on slow microcontrollers
 * Supports i2c and spi interfaces, allows to implement custom interfaces:
   * i2c (software implementation, Wire library, AVR Twi, Linux i2c-dev)
   * spi (4-wire spi via Arduino SPI library, AVR Spi, AVR USI module)
 * Primitive graphics functions (lines, rectangles, pixels, bitmaps, drawing canvas)
 * Printing text to display (using fonts of different size, [How to add new fonts](https://github.com/lexus2k/lcdgfx/wiki/How-to-create-new-font-for-the-library), [Useful tools](#useful-tools))
 * Includes [graphics engine](https://github.com/lexus2k/lcdgfx/wiki/Using-NanoEngine-for-systems-with-low-resources2) to support
   double buffering on tiny microcontrollers.
 * Can be used for game development (bonus examples):
   * Arkanoid game ([arkanoid](examples/games/arkanoid) in old style API and [arkanoid8](examples/games/arkanoid8) in new style API)
   * Simple [Lode runner](examples/games/lode_runner) game.
   * [Snowflakes](examples/nano_engine/snowflakes)

The i2c pins can be changed via API functions. Please, refer to documentation. Keep in mind,
that the pins, which are allowed for i2c or spi interface, depend on the hardware.
The default spi SCLK and MOSI pins are defined by SPI library, and DC, RST, CES pins are configurable
through API.

## Setting up

*i2c Hardware setup is described [here](https://github.com/lexus2k/lcdgfx/wiki/Hardware-setup)*

lcdgfx library requires at least c++11 and c99 (by default Digispark package misses the options
-std=gnu11, -std=gnu++11).
