## Introduction

lcdgfx driver is Arduino style C++ library with unicode support. The library can be compiled for plain Linux
(for example, raspberry spi), or you can use it with plain avr-gcc compiler without Arduino IDE. It supports
monochrome and RGB oleds and has debug mode, allowing to execute code on Linux, Windows and macOS, using SDL2.0.
Initially the library was intended to run on very small microcontrollers (with a little of RAM). It was developed to use as
few resources as possible, but still has powerful capabilities (NanoEngine), allowing to develop nice animation.
It works on any powerful devices like raspberry pi, esp32; and can be easily ported to new platform.
This library integrates another library [canvas](https://github.com/lexus2k/canvas)

## Documentation

For more information about this library, please, visit https://github.com/lexus2k/lcdgfx.
Documentation generated by doxygen tool can be found at [lcdgfx github.io site](http://lexus2k.github.io/lcdgfx).
The library provides numerous usage [examples](https://github.com/lexus2k/lcdgfx/tree/master/examples).

## Key Features

 * Supports color, monochrome OLED displays
 * The library has modular structure, and some modules can be excluded from compilation at all to reduce flash usage.
 * Needs very little RAM (Attiny85 with Damellis package needs minimum 25 bytes of RAM to communicate with OLED)
 * Fast implementation to provide reasonable speed on slow microcontrollers
 * Supports i2c and spi interfaces:
   * i2c (software implementation, Wire library, AVR Twi, Linux i2c-dev)
   * spi (4-wire spi via Arduino SPI library, AVR Spi, AVR USI module)
 * Primitive graphics functions (lines, rectangles, pixels, bitmaps, drawing canvas)
 * Printing text to display (using fonts of different size, you can use GLCD Font Creator to create new fonts)
 * Includes [graphics engine](https://github.com/lexus2k/lcdgfx/wiki/Using-NanoEngine-for-systems-with-low-resources2) to support
   double buffering on tiny microcontrollers.
 * Can be used for game development (bonus examples):
   * Arkanoid game ([arkanoid](../examples/games/arkanoid) in old style API and [arkanoid8](../examples/games/arkanoid8) in new style API)
   * Simple [Lode runner](../examples/games/lode_runner) game.
   * [Snowflakes](../examples/nano_engine/snowflakes)

The i2c pins can be changed via API functions. Please, refer to documentation. Keep in mind,
that the pins, which are allowed for i2c or spi interface, depend on the hardware.
The default spi SCLK and MOSI pins are defined by SPI library, and DC, RST, CES pins are configurable
through API.

## Easy to use

Example:

```.cpp
DisplayST7735_128x160x16_SPI display(3,{-1, 4, 5, 0,-1,-1});

void setup()
{
    display.begin();
    display.clear();
}

void loop()
{
    display.setColor(RGB_COLOR16(255,255,0));
    display.drawLine(10,30,56,96);
}
```

Digispark users, please check compilation options in your Arduino prior to using this library.
lcdgfx library requires at least c++11 and c99 (by default Digispark package misses the options
-std=gnu11, -std=gnu++11).
