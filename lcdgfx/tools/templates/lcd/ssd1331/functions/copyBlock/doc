     * Copies block in GDRAM to new position using hardware accelerator
     * features.
     * @param left left position of block to copy
     * @param top top position of block to copy
     * @param right right position of block to copy
     * @param bottom bottom position of block to copy
     * @param newLeft new left position for block being copied
     * @param newTop new top position for block being copied
     *
     * @note This API can be used only with ssd1331 RGB oled displays
     * @note after copy command is sent, it takes some time from oled
     *       controller to complete operation. So, it is highly recommended
     *       to wait for reasonable time before send other graphics operations
     *       (for example, use 250us delay). This time is required for
     *       oled display to become ready to accept new commands.
