     * @brief Sets display offset in GDRAM memory
     *
     * Some lcd displays do not use COM0, ROW0 lines. It depends on display manufacturer.
     * So, in this case you need to use setOffset() method to tell the library about this
     * hardware specific.
     * This method sets GDRAM display offset in pixels
     * @param ox x-axis offset in pixels
     * @param oy y-axis offset in pixels
